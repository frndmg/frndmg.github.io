## Summary

I am a passionate software engineer with extensive experience developing systems across diverse environments. My technical expertise spans Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, C++, C, C#, relational and non-relational databases, Docker, AWS, GCloud, Terraform and other HashiCorp products, Git and CI/CD workflows, plus frontend and backend development. I also enjoy functional programming with languages like Haskell and Clojure, though most of my professional experience has been with imperative paradigms. Throughout my career, I have learned that technical excellence goes hand-in-hand with strong teamwork and collaborative environments where both productivity and job satisfaction thrive. I am drawn to challenging problems and innovative solutions.
