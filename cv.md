## A Word

I like to program all kinds of systems, in all kind of environments. My work experience goes mostly, but it is not limited to, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, C++, C, C#, relational and non-relational databases, Docker, AWS, GCloud, Terraform (and other HashiCorp products), Git and all the related CI/CD around it, frontend and backend templating, etc. I love functional programming too, so I also use stuff like Haskell, Clojure and the like, but haven't get much work experience on it. I have been around enough to also know how important is to have a great team, and having a cohesive and vibing working environment where things get done and people feel good about it is something I put a lot of time into. I enjoy the craft and the challenge, let me know if you have something interesting to work with. Cheers!

## Experience

`Feb 2024–Jun 2025`
__Explosion GmbH__ [Berlin, Germany]

- _Senior Software Engineer_

Worked on SaaS tool for mechanical engineers, [Dive CAE](https://www.divecae.com).
I took care of the several terabytes and millions of blobs present in storage,
previously not easily searchable or queriable. The approach implemented allowed for
performing near realtime queries on the storage facing client side and internal.
We also help reduced up to 10% of the starage being consumed by unlinked and
deprecated data. Given that most of the costs (cloud wise) were coming from the storage,
this represented a substantial reduction. I also helped implementing, improving and fixing
many backend parts, including the devops side of things. We were mostly using Python, Postgres,
Terraform, Azure, and Temporal (for persistent tasks).

`Jul 2022–Present`
__Explosion GmbH__ [Berlin, Germany]

- _Full Stack Engineer_

Worked on a management SaaS tool for managing annotations and training tasks,
based on [Prodigy](https://prodigy.ai). I took, in close interaction with the
rest of the team, care of the design, implementation, testing, and shipment of
several parts of the software. The frontend was implemented client side only in
VueJS. The backend was done in FastAPI with PostgreSQL. We did deployments in
AWS and GCloud using Terraform, Nomad, and other Hashicorp open source tools.

`Apr 2020–Jul 2022`
__Signatrix GmbH__ [Berlin, Germany]

- _Software Engineer_

Worked on a on edge deployed software for super markets to classify users
intentions. Most of the backend and main apps were implemented in Python. I
took care of a complete re-write of the main frontend app used in the terminals
that used the data supplied by the classifier.

Also worked on the internal infrastructure needed to run our machine learning
pipelines. One of the applications was implemented in Rails with MongoDB. Other
tasks comprised on having our internal Python Packages Registry, updating and
extending our annotation tools, CVAT or internals. This was done using a mix
of private cluster and Google Cloud.

`Sep 2018–Sep 2020`
__University of Havana__ [Havana, Cuba]

- _Professor_

Distributed Systems and Computer Networking Professor.

I had to prepare and evaluate multiple projects and courses. In the realm of distributed systems things like Distributed Hash Tables and Consensus Algorithms were very common and fun to work with. Many of the projects imitated ideas like BitTorrent and MapReduce.
